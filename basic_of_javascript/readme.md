# First Class Functions in JavaScript

## Overview

First class functions are a core feature of JavaScript that enable functional programming by allowing functions to be treated as data. This capability makes JavaScript highly flexible, supporting constructs like higher-order functions, closures, and more.

## Characteristics of First Class Functions

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can:

1. **Be assigned to variables or constants**
2. **Be passed as arguments to other functions** (callback functions)
3. **Be returned as values from other functions**
4. **Be stored in data structures** such as arrays or objects

## Advantages of First Class Functions

* Enhance flexibility in programming paradigms
* Facilitate the creation of reusable and composable code
* Enable powerful patterns like function chaining, currying, and memoization

First class functions are foundational to understanding modern JavaScript and functional programming concepts.
